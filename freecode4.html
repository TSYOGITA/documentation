        <p>
          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
          scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
          documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
          documents into multimedia web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for
          your headings. HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the
          elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. While displaying any heading,
          browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.
